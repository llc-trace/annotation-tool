# DPIP Annotation Tool

Tool for annotating actions and gestures.

To run this install Streamlit and OpenCV

```shell
pip install streamlit
pip install opencv-python
```

Or use the requirements file:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When using the requirements file you need at least Python 3.10. With individual pip-installs at least Python 3.9 will also work.
