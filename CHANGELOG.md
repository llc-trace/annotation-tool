# Change Log

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/). Loosely because we do not keep separate sections within a version for additions and fixes etcetera, instead most logged changes will start with one of Added, Changed, Updated, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, or Security.

This project uses a simple versioning scheme with major and minor versions. Major versions are for significant updates with more than minimal functionality changes. Minor versions are for small functionality changes, documentation updates, small fixes and patches, and under-the-hood changes.

## Version 1.0 — 2025-02-17

- First version where the tool is almost ready for full blast annotation, but extensive testing is still very much appreciated.
